<section>
	<h3 class="major">Hydrofracture crevassing at glaciers and ice shelves</h3>

    <p>I am currently funded as a Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow to investigate the fundamental failure mechanisms associated with crevasse hydrofracture.</p>

<section>
	<h3 class="major">Icequakes and DAS at Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica</h3>

    <p>I am also currently developing methods of using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and conventional instrumentation to investigate icequake processes at Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica. These include understanding friction at the bed of ice streams, array processing methods and anisotropy.</p>

<section>
	<h3 class="major">Crustal Structure at Uturuncu volcano, Bolivia</h3>

    <p>I am currently using seismicity, specifically attenuation and anisotropy, to image the crustal structure of Uturuncu volcano, Bolivia.</p>

<section>
	<h3 class="major">Using dense seismic nodal arrays to image geothermal systems.</h3>

    <p>I am investigating the use of dense node arrays to study geothermal systems during the exploration phase. </p>
